# LEGO-Pieces-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Learn to Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces

## Learning Points & Summary

- use HTML Markdown in Notebooks, such as section headings # and how to embed images with the <img> tag.

- combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data

- use the .value_counts() function

- slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

- use the .agg() function to run an operation on a particular column

- rename() columns of DataFrames

- create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.

- create a scatter plot in Matplotlib

- work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys

- .merge() DataFrames along a particular column

- create a bar chart with Matplotlib
